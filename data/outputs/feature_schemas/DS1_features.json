  "checklist": "1: Understand the Job Requirements \r\n\r\nReview the job description carefully. \r\n\r\nIdentify key skills, experience levels, and qualifications needed. \r\n\r\nNote any specific certifications, technologies, or domain expertise required. \r\n\r\n2: Initial Resume Screening (Quick Scan) \r\n\r\nCheck for clear formatting and readability. \r\n\r\nLook at the summary/profile section for relevance. \r\n\r\nEnsure the candidate\u2019s location and work authorization match the job requirements. \r\n\r\n3: Technical Skill Match \r\n\r\nLook for core technical skills related to the role (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, databases). \r\n\r\nEvaluate tools and technologies proficiency (e.g., AWS, Azure, DevOps tools, etc.). \r\n\r\nCheck for relevant project experience showcasing practical application of skills. \r\n\r\n4: Work Experience Analysis \r\n\r\nVerify job titles and career progression (Are they moving up in roles?). \r\n\r\nAssess company background (Startups, enterprises, consulting firms, etc.). \r\n\r\nLook for stability vs. frequent job changes (job-hopping could be a red flag unless justified). \r\n\r\nEnsure the candidate meets the required years of experience in relevant roles. \r\n\r\n5: Certifications & Education Check \r\n\r\nValidate relevant certifications (e.g., AWS Certified, PMP, CISSP, etc.). \r\n\r\nVerify educational background (Does it align with the role?). \r\n\r\n6: Project & Hands-on Experience Evaluation \r\n\r\nLook for project details, responsibilities, and tech stack used. \r\n\r\nIdentify if the candidate has worked on similar-scale projects. \r\n\r\nCheck if they\u2019ve used modern methodologies (Agile, DevOps, CI/CD). \r\n\r\n7: Soft Skills & Communication \r\n\r\nLook for teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving skills in job descriptions. \r\n\r\nEvaluate clarity in resume writing (well-structured vs. vague descriptions). \r\n\r\nIf client interaction is needed, assess prior client-facing experience. \r\n\r\n8: Cross-check Keywords & ATS Optimization \r\n\r\nEnsure the resume contains keywords from the job description (important for ATS). \r\n\r\nLook for action verbs (developed, implemented, optimized) instead of generic descriptions. \r\n\r\n9: Red Flags to Watch For \r\n\r\nUnexplained employment gaps (Ensure valid reasons). \r\n\r\nToo many short-term jobs without contract explanations. \r\n\r\nOveruse of buzzwords without evidence of real experience. \r\n\r\nMismatch in skills vs. job experience (e.g., 2 years of experience but claims \"expert-level\" proficiency). \r\n\r\n10: Final Shortlisting & Submission \r\n\r\nPick the most relevant candidates based on skills, experience, and job fit. \r\n\r\nHighlight key strengths when submitting to hiring managers. \r\n\r\nPrepare questions for a pre-screening call before submitting to the client.
