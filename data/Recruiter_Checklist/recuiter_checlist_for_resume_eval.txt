1: Understand the Job Requirements 

Review the job description carefully. 

Identify key skills, experience levels, and qualifications needed. 

Note any specific certifications, technologies, or domain expertise required. 

2: Initial Resume Screening (Quick Scan) 

Check for clear formatting and readability. 

Look at the summary/profile section for relevance. 

Ensure the candidate’s location and work authorization match the job requirements. 

3: Technical Skill Match 

Look for core technical skills related to the role (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, databases). 

Evaluate tools and technologies proficiency (e.g., AWS, Azure, DevOps tools, etc.). 

Check for relevant project experience showcasing practical application of skills. 

4: Work Experience Analysis 

Verify job titles and career progression (Are they moving up in roles?). 

Assess company background (Startups, enterprises, consulting firms, etc.). 

Look for stability vs. frequent job changes (job-hopping could be a red flag unless justified). 

Ensure the candidate meets the required years of experience in relevant roles. 

5: Certifications & Education Check 

Validate relevant certifications (e.g., AWS Certified, PMP, CISSP, etc.). 

Verify educational background (Does it align with the role?). 

6: Project & Hands-on Experience Evaluation 

Look for project details, responsibilities, and tech stack used. 

Identify if the candidate has worked on similar-scale projects. 

Check if they’ve used modern methodologies (Agile, DevOps, CI/CD). 

7: Soft Skills & Communication 

Look for teamwork, leadership, and problem-solving skills in job descriptions. 

Evaluate clarity in resume writing (well-structured vs. vague descriptions). 

If client interaction is needed, assess prior client-facing experience. 

8: Cross-check Keywords & ATS Optimization 

Ensure the resume contains keywords from the job description (important for ATS). 

Look for action verbs (developed, implemented, optimized) instead of generic descriptions. 

9: Red Flags to Watch For 

Unexplained employment gaps (Ensure valid reasons). 

Too many short-term jobs without contract explanations. 

Overuse of buzzwords without evidence of real experience. 

Mismatch in skills vs. job experience (e.g., 2 years of experience but claims "expert-level" proficiency). 

10: Final Shortlisting & Submission 

Pick the most relevant candidates based on skills, experience, and job fit. 

Highlight key strengths when submitting to hiring managers. 

Prepare questions for a pre-screening call before submitting to the client.
